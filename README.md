Credit Card Fraud Detection using various Machine Learning Algorithms 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fraudulent transactions or activities are becoming more frequent during this digital era of banking, insurance, etc.
Across the globe, major companies are badly getting affected due to these fraudulent acts which cost them millions of dollars, revenue growth,
and most importantly losing their customer's valued trust and hence impacting their reputation within the market. 
After multiple attempts the problem was still not resolved, this is where machine learning and AI were adopted for rectifying this major global issue.

Moreover, this was my motivation to opt for this topic as my minor project. In this project, I've used various machine learning algorithms like
Decision Tree, Random Forest, Na√Øve-Bayes, Support Vector Machine, and Logistic Regression.
